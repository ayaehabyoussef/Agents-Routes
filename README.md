This script automates the daily assignment of retailers to agents based on a set of predefined priorities and retailer features. Every day, a specific number of retailers is distributed to each agent to ensure efficient coverage. The script takes as input a list of agents and a list of retailers with their corresponding attributes, such as priority level, location, type, and last visit date. It then applies a logic that ranks retailers by importance and selects a subset for each agent according to daily targets. The output is a daily route list per agent, showing which retailers they should visit. This process helps improve field productivity by making sure that the most important retailers are visited consistently.
To enhance route efficiency and consider the geographical distribution of retailers, a K-Means clustering model is applied. This helps group nearby retailers together and assign them to the most suitable agent, minimizing travel time and improving visit flow.
The project is implemented using Python scripts, SQL queries, and integration with Google Sheets for easy data input and output handling.

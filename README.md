This script automates the daily assignment of retailers to agents based on a set of predefined priorities and retailer features. Every day, a specific number of retailers is distributed to each agent to ensure efficient coverage. The script takes as input a list of agents and a list of retailers with their corresponding attributes, such as priority level, location, type, and last visit date. It then applies a logic that ranks retailers by importance and selects a subset for each agent according to daily targets. The output is a daily route list per agent, showing which retailers they should visit. This process helps improve field productivity by making sure that the most important retailers are visited consistently. The script is built in Python and can be customized easily by modifying parameters like daily visit targets or priority rules.
